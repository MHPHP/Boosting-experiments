description: >
  Whether a chess game is winnable or not, giving the following conditions:
    White side has king and rook;
    Black side has king and pawn, with pawn one move away from queening (on the second to last row);
    It is white's turn to move.
  The format of the data is as follows:
    Each instance has 36 features that describe the state of the board and a 37th feature (target) that classifies if
    a win is possible.
  Each feature corresponds to a particular position.
